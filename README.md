# Amazon to Goodreads

Ever been on book's page on Amazon and wish you could add it to Goodreads easily?

This extension allows you to click a button to open up an Amazon book in Goodreads. Then, you can mark it as want-to-read, read, read reviews, put it on any other shelf, etc.

## Todo

- [] Test it myself for a while before I package it up for wider consumption
- [] When extension is disabled/not available, change the title
- [] Disable the extension if there is no found ISBN before user click
- [] Figure out how to handle issues where you're on a kindle book page - and there is no ISBN available based on my current search
